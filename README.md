# Sparkjava Simple Starter

The sparkjava simple starter provides a basic seed or example project using Spark, Kotlin and Gradle.  While it demonstrates basic routing, error handling and templates, it will not do much more than that.  Database integration, mail notifications, authentication will be used in the [SparkJava Advanced Starter](https://github.com/thoughtlogix/sparkjava-starter-advanced) project.
